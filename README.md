# SUMMA-Actors: Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives with Actors

SUMMA-Actors is a modified version of the already existing SUMMA software that can be 
found [here](https://github.com/CH-Earth/summa#readme). SUMMA-Actors uses the Actor Model to increase scalability and fault-tolerance. It is built using the [C++ Actor Framework](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework). 

## Documentation
A more in-depth documentation can be found [here](https://summa-actors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Compiling Summa-Actors
SUMMA-Actors is written in C++ and FORTRAN and is currently tested for the following compilers:
 * g++
 * gfortran

SUMMA-Actors depends on the following Libraries:
 * [NetCDF-Fortran](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran)
 * [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS)
 * [C++ Actor Framework](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework) 

Once the following libraries have been installed SUMMA-Actors can be compiled in 
one of two ways. The first way is to modify the Makefile directly and the second 
is to invoke the makefile by shellscript:

### Method 1: Makefile
The method is best used for a workstation build that does not have access to a Compute Canada Software Stack where includes and libraries will need to be explicitly specified.

The Makefile is located in the `build` directory and the following variables will need to be uncommented and changed:
  - F_MASTER = Path/to/Summa-Actors/  # this is the directory above build/
  - FC = gfortran
  - CC = g++
  - INCLUDES = Path/to/netcdf/includes
  - LIBRARIES = Path/to/netcdf/lib 
                Path/to/openblas
                -lnetcdff -lopenblas
  - ACTORS_INCLUDES = $INCLUDES 
                      Path/to/CAF/includes
  - ACTORS_LIBRARIES = $LIBRARIES 
                       PATH/to/CAF/lib 
                       $(F_MASTER)/bin
        -lcaf_core -lcaf_io -lsumma -lopenblas -lnetcdff

After the following SUMMA-Actors can be compiled with `make`.

Once compiled you will need to set the library path variable with the following command (replace F_Master with the full path to the SUMMA-Actors directory):
`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/F_MASTER/bin`

See section Running SUMMA-Actors for instructions on how to use the program.
  
### Method 2: Shell Script
This method is best used for cluster environments that have access to the Compute Canada Software Stack. This method has been tested on the University of Saskatchewan's Copernicus and Compute Canada's Graham. This method will invoke the Makefile and no modifications should be made to the Makefile for this method.

The compilation script is located in the `build` as `compile_summa.sh`. The only variable within the compile script that needs to be changed is the `F_MASTER` path. This is the absolute path to the SUMMA-Actors directory.

Once the F_MASTER path has been specified the following command can be used to build SUMMA-Actors from the build directory:
`source compile_summa.sh`

This script should load all of the required modules from the Compute Canada Software Stack as well as set the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` required for running SUMMA-Actors.

## Running Summa-Actors

Once the binary is compiled it can be run like the following example command:

./summaMain -g 1 -n 10 -c /path/to/config/directory --config-file=/path/to/actors/config/file

 -g = starting index of the first GRU to compute
 -c = number of grus to run
 -m = path to the file manager
 OPTIONAL: --config-file = /path/to/config/file
  This config file specifies to the C++ Actor Framework how many threads to use when executing the program. If left out the C++ Actor Framework will automatically set this value based on your system.

#### Config File ####
SUMMA-Actors settings can be modified from a JSON file provided in config/Summa_Actors_Settings.json.
There are three types of actors that can be configured:
  * SummaActor
    - OutputStructureSize = The number of timesteps in which an HRU can hold before needing to contact 
    the file_access_actor to write the data to a file.
    - maxGRUPerJob = The number of GRUs that will be attemtpted to run at once. For example, if this value 
    is set to 500 and you invoke the program with ./summaMain -g 1 -n 1000 -c /path/to/config/directory. 
    SUMMA-Actors will only spawn 500 actors at a time and compute all 1000 in two batches.

    Both of the above setting control the amount of RAM SUMMA-Actors uses. Larger numbers can cause your 
    job to run out of memory. We have found that setting both to 500 uses around 20GB of RAM for reference.

  * JobActor
    - FileManagerPath = Path the the fileManager.txt file needed by SUMMA. This is remained relativley 
    unchanged from the original version of SUMMA. With two additions. An example file is provided in the 
    config/ directory called fileManager_example.txt
    - outputCSV = Boolean value for if you would like individual HRU run-time statsicts when they complete.
    - csvPath = The path that the csv file will be written to.
  
  * HRUActor
    - printOutput = Boolean value for if you would like each HRU to print information on where it is in 
    its computation. ie. what timestep it is on and some other timing information.
    - outputFrequency = The frequency in which you would like an HRU printing to stdout. The number specified is the interval in timesteps in which an HRU will print. Note: Lower numbers can see decreased performance as stdout will begin to lag the more that needs to be printed.
